# CARDEXDEMO

CARDEXDEMO is a small demo project showing off a single game feature. It’s just a quick example to share one idea and maybe spark some inspiration.

This was made for fun and to practice programming. It’s not something I plan to update or maintain.

Even if it doesn’t get more features, CARDEXDEMO is here as a reference for anyone curious about this kind of mechanic.
