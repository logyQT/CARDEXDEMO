## How to Use

-   To get trophies, use the **Random Trophy** button or upload a `.hrs` save file located in `%localappdata%/CarDealerSimulator/Saved`.
-   To slot a trophy, simply press an empty slot.
-   All changes are saved instantly, and your progress is kept inside the browser's local storage.

## Potential Features

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

-   **Rewards:** Unlock cosmetic upgrades or new gameplay functionalities as you progress.
-   **Search:** Quickly find specific cars using a search bar.
-   **Sorting:** Organize the trophy index by name, type, or other attributes.
-   **Filtering:** View only missing or owned cars to track collection progress more easily.

Even if it doesn’t receive more features, the demo serves as a reference for anyone interested in this type of mechanic.

Some features are missing and may or may not be implemented in the future. The current version focuses on a single mechanic, but additional functionality could be added later depending on interest or available time.

## Limitations

Please note that this demo is not highly flexible or responsive. The app may display incorrectly on smaller devices or screens. For the best experience, use a desktop browser.
